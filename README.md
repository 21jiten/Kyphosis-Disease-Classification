# Kyphosis Disease Classification

This project aims to classify cases of kyphosis disease using machine learning techniques. Kyphosis is a medical condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine, which can lead to various health issues. Early detection and classification of kyphosis cases are essential for effective treatment and management.

## Introduction

Kyphosis is an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine. The kyphosis data frame has 81 rows and 4 columns. representing data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery. Dataset contains 3 inputs and 1 output

INPUTS:
- Age: in months
- Number: the number of vertebrae involved
- Start: the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.

OUTPUTS:
- Kyphosis: a factor with levels absent present indicating if a kyphosis (a type of deformation) was present after the operation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abbasit/kyphosis-dataset]. It contains features such as age, number of vertebrae involved, and the angle of the kyphotic curve, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of kyphosis after corrective spinal surgery.

## Approach

Our approach involves the following steps:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and validation.

We will employ various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to build a robust classification model.

## Results

The performance of the classification model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also visualize the model's performance using appropriate graphs and charts.
